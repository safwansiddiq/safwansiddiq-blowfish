  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>No two projects are the same and I take a pragmatic approach to each job I take on, focussing on delivering work that is as accessible and optimised as possible.</p>
    
    <p>More than a decade of experience building complex interfaces means that I'm happy to deliver anything from single-page apps to scaleable design systems.</p>

    <p>I sweat the little details that bring a design to life. Good <strong>interaction design</strong> grounds an interface with a sense of space and logic.</p>
    
    <p>I combine nuanced timing and motion with a deep understanding of browser rendering to deliver logical interactions.</p>
